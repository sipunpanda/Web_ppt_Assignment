Q. Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some 
global attributes?

Ans -> In HTML, there are two main concepts: tags and attributes.

1. **HTML Tags**:
   HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They define the structure and 
   content of a webpage. Tags are represented by angle brackets (`<` and `>`) and come in 
   pairs - an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the name of the element, 
   while the closing tag has the same name but with a forward slash before it (`</`). 
   The content between the opening and closing tags is the content of the element.

   Example of an HTML tag:
   <p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>
   

2. **HTML Attributes**:
   HTML attributes are used to provide additional information or settings to HTML elements. 
   They are applied within the opening tag and provide extra properties to the element. 
   Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (`=`). 
   The value is usually enclosed in double quotes. Attributes can be used to control the 
   appearance, behavior, or functionality of an element.

   Example of an HTML attribute:
   
   <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image">

**Global Attributes**:
Global attributes are attributes that can be applied to most HTML elements. 
They are not specific to any particular tag and can be used across different elements.

Some examples of global attributes are:
- `id`: Specifies a unique identifier for an element.
- `class`: Assigns one or more class names to an element for CSS styling or JavaScript manipulation.
- `style`: Applies inline CSS styles directly to the element.
- `title`: Provides additional information about the element (usually displayed as a tooltip).
- `lang`: Specifies the language of the content within the element.
- `data-*`: Allows custom data attributes to be added for JavaScript to access and manipulate.
- `tabindex`: Specifies the order of focus for keyboard navigation.
- `aria-*`: Provides accessibility information for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

In short, HTML tags define the structure and content of a webpage, while HTML attributes 
provide additional information or settings to elements. Global attributes are attributes
 that can be applied to many HTML elements and are not specific to any particular tag.
