Q. What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?

Ans -> The `<figure>` tag and the `<img>` tag serve different purposes in HTML and have 
distinct roles:

1. `<img>` tag:
   The `<img>` tag is used to embed images into a web page. It is a void element, which 
   means it does not have a closing tag. The `<img>` tag requires a `src` attribute, 
   which specifies the URL of the image to be displayed. Additionally, you can include 
   optional attributes such as `alt`, `width`, `height`, etc.

   Example of using the `<img>` tag:
   
   <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image" width="300" height="200">
  
   In this example, the `<img>` tag displays the image `example.jpg`, and the `alt` attribute 
   provides alternative text for the image (important for accessibility and SEO purposes).

2. `<figure>` tag:
   The `<figure>` tag is used to group multimedia content, such as images, illustrations, 
   videos, audio, etc., and their respective captions using the `<figcaption>` tag. 
   The purpose of the `<figure>` element is to associate the content and its caption together.

   Example of using the `<figure>` tag with `<figcaption>`:
   
   <figure>
     <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image" width="300" height="200">
     <figcaption>Figure 1: This is an example image.</figcaption>
   </figure>

So, the key difference is that the `<img>` tag is specifically used for embedding images, 
while the `<figure>` tag is used to group multimedia content along with its associated caption. 
The `<figure>` tag is useful when you want to semantically associate an image or other 
multimedia elements with explanatory text or captions.
