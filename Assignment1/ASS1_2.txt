Q. Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

Ans -> Semantic tags in HTML are elements that carry meaning or convey the purpose and 
structure of the content within the tags. These tags provide a way to describe the different 
sections and elements of a web page in a more meaningful and understandable manner.

Some examples of semantic tags introduced in HTML5 include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, 
`<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and many more. 
These tags help to define the purpose and role of different parts of a web page.


-> semantic tags enhance the semantics and meaning of HTML documents, improving 
accessibility, search engine optimization, code maintainability, and future compatibility. 
They contribute to a better web experience for both humans and machines.
